		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In part one, we started writing this very page. This part tasked us with using the most commonly used
		HTML tags to write a page that will keep track and comment on the rest of the work we do in this class.
		This introduced us to basic formatting and HTML. In part two, we made a lesson about a topic that have interest in. This built further upon the parts from part 1.
		Introducing some more parts of HTML such as images and ordered lists. We also had to format and display a lot more text than
		in part 1. Part three introduced us to tables and tags. I learned how to create links directly to HTML elements and how to create a well structured table.
		Part four was out first introduction to CSS and formatting. I learned how to link CSS files to HTML and how to edit and format the various elements of HTML to my liking.
		After this assignment, I feel like I have a good basic understanding of both HTML5 and CSS to build off of on my future assignments.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn basic HTML: headings, paragraphs, lists, hyperlinks, and tables</li>
			<li>Introduce the format for the assignments and the tools we'll be using to complete them</li>
			<li>Learn basic CSS and how to format and change your HTML elements to your liking</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
		</a>


		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In part one, I wrote a simple form using various elements of html input to create a mailing address formatter.
		This built on the html and css or previous assignment but also added in new tools. In part two I implement the logic and
		control structures of the form I had just made. Since this was our first dive into JavaScript I learned a lot especially about handing data and how to make a web-page change based off user input. In part 3, I made a visual abstraction of my logic to be able to understand and implement what I wanted out of the tool. After this assignment, I feel like I have further developed my html and css skills as well as learning JavaScript and html DOM.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn HTML input and outputs</li>
			<li>Visualize program logic in a flowchart</li>
			<li>Learn JavaScript and it's interactions with html and input and output</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
		</a>


		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In part one, I wrote a simple form to receive a list of values from the user. I then wrote a function that took in that input
			and parsed it into an array of integers. In part two, I wrote a javascript file with various statistical functions to use with
			the user's values. This includes but is not limited to mean, variance, and mode. I then wrote code to implement this library as well as
			output the calculated values in the index.html file. In part 3, I tested my application against excel on three data sets that varied in size as well as range.
			I then complied the results in the unit tests page. After this assignment, I feel comfortable linking external javascript files and using a
			library in my website.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Further develop HTML input and output</li>
			<li>Further develop javascript and learn how to build and use a js library</li>
			<li>Practice unit testing our javascript library</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
		</a>


		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In this assignment we made a much more responsive and polished version of the assignment we made in assignment two.
			I again made a website to format a mailing address from a couple of use inputs. I used the bootstrap library
			to format and organize my website. I then used jquery to handle validation and the logic to format the address. This assignment
			introduced me to bootstrap and jquery and showed me the benefits over traditional html and js.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the basics of Bootstrap and the benefit over standard HTML</li>
			<li>Develop a reactive cross-platform website</li>
			<li>Learn the basics jquery</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
		</a>


		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In this assignment we started working with php and server side web development. We made a simple quiz in which we would take
			our users responses grade them as well as storing them in a csv file server side. We also made a tool to visualize the data
			that we stored as well as draw inferences from that data. This assignment show me the power of php and how to connect front facing and back facing
			web development.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the basics of php</li>
			<li>Understand why it is important to handle data away from the front user</li>
			<li>Learn how to interface front facing and back facing sites.</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Assignment 6</h2>
		</a>


		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In this assignment we continued working with php and server side web development. We made a mysql table in which we would take
			our responses from our reviewers and insert them. We visualized our table using an ERD diagram. We also learned
			one of the most common attacks on SQL and how to combat it. This assignment showed me how to interface a front end
			webapp with a database safely and securely.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Continue learning of php</li>
			<li>Learn how to create and manipulate a database</li>
			<li>How to program a web app to control a database safely and securely</li>
		</ul>
