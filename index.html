		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In part one, we started writing this very page. This part tasked us with using the most commonly used
		HTML tags to write a page that will keep track and comment on the rest of the work we do in this class.
		This introduced us to basic formatting and HTML. In part two, we made a lesson about a topic that have interest in. This built further upon the parts from part 1. 
		Introducing some more parts of HTML such as images and ordered lists. We also had to format and display a lot more text than
		in part 1. Part three introduced us to tables and tags. I learned how to create links directly to HTML elements and how to create a well structured table.
		Part four was out first introduction to CSS and formatting. I learned how to link CSS files to HTML and how to edit and format the various elements of HTML to my liking.
		After this assignment, I feel like I have a good basic understanding of both HTML5 and CSS to build off of on my future assignments.

			<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
		</a>
		
		
		<h3>Reflection:</h3>
		<p>In part one, I wrote a simple form using various elements of html input to create a mailing address formatter.
		This built on the html and css or previous assignment but also added in new tools. In part two I implement the logic and
		control structures of the form I had just made. Since this was our first dive into JavaScript I learned a lot especially about handing data and how to make a web-page change based off user input. In part 3, I made a visual abstraction of my logic to be able to understand and implement what I wanted out of the tool. After this assignment, I feel like I have further developed my html and css skills as well as learning JavaScript and html DOM.</p>
